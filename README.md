 HotelManagement
 ===============
 Hi, everyone. I make a HotelManagement Program. My Program is so simple, so i think that everyone can understand so easily. Now, I will explain the composition of my program.
 
 The first thing to do is make a Hotel size. To making this, I use array[floor][room].
 And I devide into the following areas.
 ### 1. Check In
  * It decide which room in the hotel you will enter. you input floor & room number and write your name. 
  
 ### 2. Check Out
  * It maeans you are leaving the hotel. You input your floor & room number and check your name.
 
 ### 3. Display
  * It shows the hotel's room status.
  
 ### 4. Exit
  * It means exit the program.
  
  As you can see from reading, It's so simple program right? I hope this program is helpful, and if you have anyfeedback please tell me.
  Thank you everyone.
